       <p class="h1">Between the drop-dead gorgeous mountain views and the Rhône river backdrops, it’s no wonder why people travel all over the world to go to Geneva. 
          <br>
        <br> Originally built in 1950, the luxury hotel offers 189 fully renovated elegant rooms, 27 which are suites. While you may never want to leave, the highlight of it all is it’s prime location 5 minutes away from Geneva’s historic Old Town, cultural, and touristic districts.

        <p class="h1">During my stay, I checked into a Deluxe River View King Room. My room included a large seating area, a comfy sofa, a walk-in closet, a marble bathroom, and most importantly a view of the river. 
           <br>
           <br>TIf you’re looking for something a bit more spacious, other suites include a fireplace, living rooms, a terrace, dining areas, a jacuzzi, and panoramic views. We’re talking up to 5400 square feet of space.</p>

       <p class="h1"> If you’re looking to get dressed up and enjoy a fine-dining meal, Rasoi by Vineet, the first fine dining Indian restaurant in Geneva, is the perfect spot for you. The vibrant red and black decor compliments the contemporary Indian cuisine.
           <br>
           <br>For a faster-paced meal or Sunday brunch, be sure to stop by Café Calla. Their French-inspired menu includes things like salads, ceviche, pasta, land and sea plates, along with a wide variety of wines from their 1500-bottle cellar.
