    On my first trip to the continent of Africa,
    I was lucky enough to spend about a week exploring the wonders of Cape Town.
    I ended up returning to Cape Town the following year and have been calling it my home away from home for the past year and a half!
    The city has stunning natural landscapes, delicious and diverse cuisines and so many activities for all ages.
    It is also a cosmopolitan city with a wealth of historical sites, cafés, and lively nightlife.

      <p class="h1">Old-Hollywood glamour and colonial grandeur come together to create the magnetic atmosphere at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town. 
        Nestled at the foot of the iconic Table Mountain, this hotel is a luxury escape in the heart of Cape Town.

       <p class="h1">As one of the city’s premier five-star hotels, Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town is simply gorgeous. 
          <br>
          <br>This chic property has two outdoor swimming pools, a well-equipped fitness center (don’t miss the outdoor yoga and Pilates here), tennis courts, a family activity center and a luxury spa.</p>

            </div>
      <p class="h1"> You really can’t go wrong with your room choice, so it just depends on your group size, budget and style. All of the rooms feature a view of the hotel gardens or Table Mountain, as well as gorgeous marble bathrooms.
          <br>
          <br>Deluxe Rooms include a separate sitting area if you need some room to spread out, and there are options available with a balcony for soaking in the sun. Junior Suites have a bedroom with an open-plan lounge area, and you’ve got the option to upgrade to the oversized Deluxe Junior Suites.
          <br>
          <br>For a classic pick, the Superior Rooms offer a king-size or twin bed in a cozy space. And, be sure to check out the restored historic cottages! These were made just for couples looking for a romantic hideaway.
