          Morocco is a country that draws you in. From the colorful, heady markets filled with the rich scents of spices to the vibrant Atlas Mountains, there is just so much to see in this incredible North African country. 
          While you can have a great time hitting up the main spots over a few days, I highly recommend lingering in Morocco to uncover all of the hidden treasures.</div>

          <br>
        <br> All the Riad Yasmine team has in heart to make your stay unforgettable and to make you feel in your home away from home.

        <p class="h1">During my stay, I checked into Imsouane room, which is perfect for one or two people.
           <br>
           <br>It is on the first floor with a 140cm bed and a cosy lounge area. Inspired by the bright colors of the small port of Imsouane, the room is decorated with objects unearthed. The bathroom is decorated with golden highlights,which made me feel like a princess.</p>

               <img src="leriadroom.jpg" alt="Zimmer1" style="width: 700px;height: 400px">
             </div>
       <p class="h1"> Safe haven of peace, every resident guests can enjoy the swimming pool in zelliges with its mattress, but also the patio for its freshness and its corner living room, offering an open invitation to laziness.
           <br>
           <br>The big rooftop bar offers a breath-taking view on the medina and the Koutoubia, Medersa Ben Youssef and the snow-capped Atlas. The wide solarium equipped with towels and hats gave me the possibility to unwind in the sun or in the shade of a parasol.
